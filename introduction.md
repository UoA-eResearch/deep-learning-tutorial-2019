# Welcome to Introduction to Deep Learning workshop 2019

Our goal in this workshop is to provide you a good understanding in deep learning and inspire you to learn more and implement these models to your own research problems.

Over the decades, deep learning has revolutionised many aspects of research and technology.

Have you ever used Siri to set an alarm?

Maybe you've seen clips of self-driving cars on the internet or perhaps in person.

Maybe your phone is able to unlock by facial recognition

Or maybe you've learn of artificial intelligence being used in medicine

These are all examples of Deep Learning

## Deep learning is commonly heard of but what does it mean?

Artificial Intelligence can be defined as a computer system that mimics human intelligence.

Machine Learning can be defined as learning without being explicity programmed to do so.

Deep Learning is a subset of that which is learning to identify patterns in data using neural networks.

## What will you learn today?

Today you will learn the fundamentals of deep learning and go through some of the most common case studies with neural networks.

You will use Keras to create your first deep learning models. Keras is an open-source neural-network library running on top of Tensorflow written in Python. It is designed to be easy to use and to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks.
