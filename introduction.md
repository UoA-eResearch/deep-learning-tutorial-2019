# Deep-Learning Tutorial

Hi everyone, welcome to our deep-learning tutorial. In this workshop we will go over some of the most fundamental and common use cases for creating neural networks.

Over the decades, deep learning has revolutionised many aspects of research and technology.

Have you ever used Siri to set an alarm?

Face recognition?

## What will you learn today?

(Repetitive with the initial intro) Today you will learn how to tackle some of the most common and fundamental case studies using deep-learning.

We will do this using the various python packages, most notably we will be using Keras, a high-level machine-learning packaged based off Tensor Flow which is widely used in the machine-learning industry.

With this knowledge and tooling we hope to provide a good basis(?) for you to experiment and explore creating deep-learning models solutions.

## Agenda 

We will go over three exercises today.

* In the simplest case, we're going to learn how deep-learning can be used to diagnose disease.

* Next, in a slightly more complex situation, we're going to classify flowers into species using their morphology.

* Finally, we will go over creating a convolutional network in order to identify digits from images of handwritten characters which will touch on the fundamental of computer vision and convolutions in deep-learning.
